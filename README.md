# SurViral2 with JANEbox Games

This project is a multiplayer, storyline game that allows players to work together
and defeat a viral enemy and save the world! 

This project was originally built as part of the mintbean.io Multiplayer Game Hackathon
with the challenge to build a multiplayer, turn-based online game.

The original project can be found here for the [server repo](https://github.com/connietran-dev/janebox-surviral-server)
and [client repo](https://github.com/connietran-dev/janebox-surviral-client)

This repo is a refactor and expansion of the original project
